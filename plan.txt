Extensions:
[ ] Multiple room types / random generators
    <x> Tunnel - store direction, continue random distance
    < > Geometric chambers - establish wall hits randomly, but maintain rectangular shape
    < > Parametrize existing generator: change probability of wall
    < > Open caverns: Generation based on wall ends, closed simple loop (work out behaviour if not following walls)
    --------
    <\> To implement, extend Dungeon appropriately, move relevant responsibilities to subclasses
        Need a Dungeon to contain the whole, with references to Rooms to resolve randomness
        ---------
        Design elements:
        (\) Dungeon still holds the map, as well as providing (most of) the interface
        (\) Tiles hold a reference to a --wall generator-- room
        (\) Generator is called by Dungeon, and has access to map (for collision detection)
        (x) Adding new rooms: change Dungeon::setcurrent to work on unseen cells; other methods?
[ ] Doors
[ ] Autowalkers
    < > Maybe store all open edges?
[ ] Graphics?

Fixes:
[ ] Update existing autowalker for new engine
[ ] Tests
[ ] We do a lot of testing for dimensions, move to access functions?
[X] Add in keyboard control
[ ] Speed up rendering -- probable culprit: loops of document.getElement
    < > Iterate through list of children instead of repeated id searching
    < > Guarantuee that divs get added in order, so searching/looping becomes unnecessary

Other:
[\] Git, when sufficiently clean
    On git, but not really clean...
[X] Refactor: split out modules

Bugs:
[\] Count is occasionally high: possibly when two opens border on the same unseen
    [ ] Could not reproduce. Fixed?
